name:                traverse-with-class
version:             0.1
synopsis:            Generic applicative traversals
description:         This is a generic programming library in the spirit of
                     \"Scrap your boilerplate with class\", but with several
                     improvements â€” most notably, it's based on the @gtraverse@
                     function instead of @gfoldl@.

                     @gtraverse@ is equivalent in power to @gfoldl@, but lets
                     you more easily write non-standard views of the data type.
