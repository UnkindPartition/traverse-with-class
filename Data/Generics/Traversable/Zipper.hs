--
-- Compared to the original @syz@ package, this implementation (based on
-- 'GTraversable') gives more flexibility as to where a zipper may point
-- to and what is considered as siblings.
--
-- Specifically, a zipper may point to any element which `gtraverse`
-- applies its function to.
--
-- == Example
-- === syz
-- Consider the classical example: lists. With syz, a list is interpreted as a right-balanced
-- tree.
--
-- >>> let z = fromJust . down' $ toZipper ['a'..'d']
-- >>> getHole z :: Maybe Char
-- Just 'a'
--
-- The zipper @z@ points to the first element of the list. Now let's
-- move to the right:
--
-- >>> let z' = fromJust . right $ z
-- >>> getHole z' :: Maybe Char
-- Nothing
-- >>> getHole z' :: Maybe [Char]
-- Just "bcd"
--
-- Instead of pointing to the second element of the list, as one might
-- expect, the zipper @z\'@ points to the tail of the list. In order to
-- actually move to the second element, we need another 'down'':
--
-- >>> let z'' = fromJust . down' $ z'
-- >>> getHole z'' :: Maybe Char
-- Just 'b'
--
-- === traverse-with-class
-- 'GTraversable'-based zippers behave more intuitively in this regard,
-- thanks to the uniform instance for lists.
--
-- >>> let z = fromJust . down' $ toZipper ['a'..'d'] :: Zipper Typeable [Char]
-- >>> getHole z :: Maybe Char
-- Just 'a'
--
-- So far it's more or less the same as with syz. We needed to add a type
-- annotation for the zipper itself to clarify the context which should
-- be available at each hole ('Typeable' in this case). Now let's see
-- what's to the right of us:
--
-- >>> let z' = fromJust . right $ z
-- >>> getHole z' :: Maybe Char
-- Just 'b'
--
-- That is, we jumped right to the second element of the list. Likewise,
--
-- >>> let z'' = rightmost z
-- >>> getHole z'' :: Maybe Char
-- Just 'd'
--
-- So, unlike in @syz@, all of the list elements are siblings.
